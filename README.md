# CSS3 Burns Effect for jQuery Cycle 2

I typically use the jQuery Cycle 2 plugin as my go-to slideshow handler - http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2

This is a work-in-progress attempt at giveing the default slider a "Ken Burns" effect on each slide. View it in action at https://daveyank.github.io/jquery-cycle-burns/.

I have found other sliders with the Burns effect but none of them handled the responsive side of things as well as I liked. The jQuery Cycle 2 plugin has always made it pretty simple to create a nice responsive slider, and also works really well in a full-window view.

Again, this is a work-in-progress. ;)
