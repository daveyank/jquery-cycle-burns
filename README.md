# CSS3 Burns Effect for jQuery Cycle 2

I typically use the jQuery Cycle 2 plugin as my go-to slideshow handler - http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2

This is a work-in-progress attempt at giveing the default slider a "Ken Burns" effect on each slide. View it in action at https://daveyank.github.io/jquery-cycle-burns/.

Again, this is a work-in-progress. ;)
