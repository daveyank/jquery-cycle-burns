# CSS3 Burns Effect for jQuery Cycle 2

I typically use the jQuery Cycle 2 plugin as my go-to slideshow handler - http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2

This is my work-in-progress attempt at giving the default slider a "Ken Burns" effect with the background image of each slide. View it in action at https://daveyank.github.io/jquery-cycle-burns/.

I have found other sliders with the Burns effect but none of them handled the responsive side of things as well as I liked, and most of them involved using an actua image element instead of the slider background image. The jQuery Cycle 2 plugin has always made it simple to create a nice responsive slider, and also works really well in a full-window view which is what I am demoing in this instance. By using background images, this makes it possible to easily overlay content on top of each slide without being affected by the Burns effect happening on the image.

Again, this is a work-in-progress.
